# Test cases for software testing course project
This repository will serve the purpose of gathering up all the test cases that the students have worked on in order to centralize and offer inspiration for students when coming up with scenarios to automate for their final project along with also increasing their collaboration.<br/>
Each student will create a fork of the original project, in the forked repository, they will create their own branch and under the **Main_page** folder, they will create their own ``.feature`` file which will include the name of the section they have worked on in Trello. The naming of the ``.feature`` files should respect the ``Testcase_section_name.feature``<br/>
For example, if I worked on the email section, the name of my feature file will be: ``Testcase_email.feature``<br/>
The test cases you write will require following the **Gherkin syntax** which you can find the reference to [here](#https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#feature).<br/>

After each student will create their ``.feature`` files, the below table should be updated with the number of test cases contained within each of the files.

| Section tested | Feature file name | No. test cases | First name of tester(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Email (example) | Testcase_email.feature| 2 | Andrei|
